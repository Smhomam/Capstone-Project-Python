# Capstone-Project-Python

This is basically a dataset that we took from kaggle datasets.
It is based on Netflix 

In this dataset it has categoried the data of netflix on the basis of rating,cast,director,year, type etc

We chose this set to implement our function taught in workshop
and to see the outcome . We have tried deep filtering the data, also some other things on the basis of rating, year, type of show etc

Hope we present ourselves at the best .
